       <li>You can <span> easily adjust the vegetables </span> to suit the seasons or your pantry (see recipe notes).</li> 
       <li>The sauce is made from scratch with basic ingredients. It only takes a few minutes to make.</li>
       <li>Use no-boil noodles and you donâ€™t have to bother cooking them. Just layer them up!</li>
       <li>I recommend cottage cheese instead of ricotta, which has more protein and flavor (trust me).</li>
       <li>You can even make this recipe gluten free and/or vegan. See the recipe notes for details.</li>
